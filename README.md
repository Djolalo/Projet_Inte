Quick message from Djilali for potential recruiters:
Alice helped me a lot to write the GenerationProcedurale script, which consists of my whole work for this project. 
I think it should pick your interest, but it was my duty to inform that it's our teamplay which allowed it.  
I mainly explored Procedural generation, to create pseudo-random maps thanks to perlin noise and L-systems. 
It has room for improvement, but I'm still proud. 
(find it in the following location : My project/Assets/Assembly/GenerationProcedurale.cs)
